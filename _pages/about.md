# About Me 

I‚Äôm a second-year master's student in Automation at *[Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://english.bit.edu.cn/)*. As a member of *State Key Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Systems*, I'm advised by Prof. [Chengpu Yu](https://ac.bit.edu.cn/szdw/dsmd/sssds/mssbyznxt/69e8a71ad78346fb87e6765e0f2549ab.htm). I received my B.Eng. degree in Measurement & Control Technology from *[China University of Mining & Technology (CUMT), Beijing](https://english.cumtb.edu.cn/)* in 2021.

The goal of my research is to enhance the autonomy of robots. Currently, I'm focusing on autonomous exploration systems and its supporting technologies, such as SLAM, motion planning, and multi-robot collaboration.

  **[TDLE: 2D Lidar Exploration with Hierarchical Planning Using Regional Division](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02852)**

  IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE), Auckland, New Zealand, 2023 

  **Xuyang Zhao**, Chengpu Yu, Erpei Xu and Yixuan Liu

  - Proposed an exploration system that uses global dynamic regional division and localized metric evaluation to achieve efficient autonomous mapping with low computational requirements. The proposed method can run at high frequencies (>100Hz) on low-power edge platforms like Jetson Nano, while offering up to 57.57% efficiency improvement compared to former methods.

- *2021.10 - now*, **Indoor Navigation and Detection Based on Air-Ground Platform Collaboration. (Core Member)** 
  
  [National Key R&D Program] 

  In disaster relief scenarios, there is a safety risk for rescuers when they enter damaged buildings, such as those affected by an earthquake. To tackle this issue, we have developed a LiDAR exploration and mapping system. The proposed system conduct indoor information surveys and return autonomously after completion, helping to inspect the internal environment and find trapped people.
  
  The whole process requires no remote control or pre-specified routes, as the decision is made entirely by the on-board processing unit.

- *2020.05 - 2020.09*, **ROS Smart Car Racing. (Team Leader)** 

  [China's 15th National Collegiate Smart Car Race] To achieve higher speed in the racing, besides device adjustment and tuning, we carried out the following tasks: (1) Distortion correction for LiDAR mapping process; (2) Introduction of strong constraints for obstacle avoidance in local planners; (3) Construction of LiDAR-IMU Odometry (LIO). These efforts led to a successful advancement in the simulation race of the North China division and then a national second prize in the final competition.
